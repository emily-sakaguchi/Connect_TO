As part of the improvements to the East Don Trail system, residents asked to have the rainbow restored. The City’s Parks Forestry and Recreation engaged Mural Routes to restore the mural and to enhance it by painting the interior of the tunnel and adding another rainbow at the other end. Participants in mural workshops held at Flemingdon Library helped with the design concept. Lead artist Rob Matejka was assisted by Anthony Delacruz, local youth and many volunteers to paint the mural.

As the climate warmed, glacier meltwater eroded deep valleys, forming several rivers in the area. In the nearby Evergreen Brick Works quarry, geologists have discovered evidence of three glaciation periods that took place over 120,000 years, creating the distinct Don Valley we see today. It took thousands of years for nature to form the Don Valley landscape. However, since the arrival of Euro-Canadian settlers just two centuries ago, it has been significantly altered by local landowners and major City initiatives in efforts to harness this natural resource. From the 1880s to early 1900s, City Council established initiatives to straighten and widen the river below Gerrard Street East, opening up land for developments such as railways and the Don Valley Parkway, and addressing run-off that was polluting the Don River waters. Despite earlier efforts, pollution, erosion and flooding continued to be a problem throughout the 1900s. To address this, the Don Valley has undergone one of the largest regeneration projects in the world. Initiated in the late 1980s, this effort has seen the restoration of native plant species, wetlands and the establishment of recreational trails, with the help of community groups such as the Todmorden Wildlife Preserve and the Don Watershed Regeneration Council.

Many members came to Toronto from the United States through the Underground Railroad. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was originally founded in 1797 in Philadelphia by Richard Allen, a former slave who bought his own freedom, and today, the Church has three million members worldwide. At first, members of the Grant AME congregation met in each other's homes for worship until the church moved to a permanent space on Soho Street in downtown Toronto in 1929. It relocated to Gerrard Street in 1991. The church is a lively centre of the community with over 300 members, 40 ministries, many choirs, praise ministries, dance ministries, active youth groups and a band. The Womens Missionary School conducts outreach, and the Lay Organization and Harriet Tubman Organization works with youth to provide educational and mentorship programs and financial support. First constructed in 1926 and home of the Glenmount United Church for 74 years, it was purchased in 1985 by the progressive Metropolitan Community Church, resulting in the first LGBTQ group in Canada to own property. At the time, the church was under the leadership of Reverend Brent Hawkes, who is known for conducting the first same-sex marriage ceremony in Canada on January 14, 2001 (although the marriages were not registered until 2003). In 2008, Reverend Hawkes received the Order of Canada for championing human rights and social justice for decades.

Today, Colonel Samuel Smith Park is a popular spot for its bike and pedestrian trails and for sport activities. The park offers remarkable vistas of Lake Ontario, and the land is home to over 1,200 trees and is visited by many migrating birds.

Dundas Street became a vein along which new farms and villages were nurtured and Islington was one of those villages. People came from the surrounding farmlands to retrieve and deliver mail, purchase food, clothing, and tools, and to share news and enjoy the social life in this small community. Today, Islington Village is incredibly rich in art and history.

Today, this concept is considered isolating. Currently, designers work to bring the buildings close to the street, placing commercial shops on the ground level and surrounding towers with low-rise buildings such as town houses to increase access to amenities and combat isolation.

In 1830, he leased 80 hectares of land bound by Islington Avenue, Dundas Street, Royal York Road and Bloor Street. He built this Inn that same year. Montgomery’s Inn has become a local landmark and is the second oldest building in Etobicoke. In addition to being an innkeeper, Montgomery was a farmer and a real estate and mortgage investor, acquiring over 250 other properties across Ontario in his lifetime. The food produced on this farm fed the travellers and local residents who ate at his inn. The fieldstone building was constructed in the late Georgian or Loyalist architecture styles. This style is illustrated by its large centre hall plan and strong symmetry. It was covered with a white pebbledash finish, but during renovations in 1967, the borough of Etobicoke removed it to reveal the beautiful fieldstone underneath. For Islington Village and its neighbouring communities, inns were important community centres providing inexpensive overnight accommodation, social drinking and tavern meals. Montgomery’s Inn also hosted the Home District Council’s township meetings in 1847 and 1849. In the days of early settlement, transportation was slow. Taverns and inns were a necessary presence at regular intervals on major roads. Today, Montgomery’s Inn, operated by the City of Toronto’s Museums & Heritage Services, is a strong reminder of Islington Village’s past.

The original stucco church was completed in 1847. In 1894, the church was raised and placed on a new stone foundation to provide a basement. At the same time, the stucco walls were covered with brick and a front porch was added. In 1937, the church was lengthened to provide space for a growing population after World War II. Inside the church, old stained glass windows are interspersed with the new, including three windows in particular, which depict the history of the Village of Islington. In the first window, a missionary preaches to First Nations peoples. In the second, a farmer works his field with St.  George's in the background. In the third, St. George's sits among other local churches, all offshoots of the church of St. George's. Today, the site remains a thriving centre within the Islington community.

On the east side of Mimico Creek, this rich soil was also found on the property of Thomas Montgomery's descendants. From 1900 to 1944, Montgomery's Inn was rented out to a series of market gardeners that grew vegetables south of the Inn. Many Chinese farmers worked as market gardeners when they came to Canada. From the 1930s they were all gardeners of Chinese origin, with the last Chinese gardeners being Joe and Lillie Chung from 1942 to 1944. The Chungs' son, Willie, remembers that they grew cabbages, celery and tomatoes and delivered them by truck to sell at the St. Lawrence Market. Every winter in the 1940s and 50s, members of Islington's Volunteer Fire Brigade diverted water from Mimico Creek to flood Central Park (Tom Riley Park) on the west side of Mimico Creek in exactly the same spot Robert Tier's market garden had once been. The result was a large outdoor skating rink described as four times the size of the standard schoolyard skating surface.

In 1999, the Humber River was designated as a Canadian Heritage River in recognition of its cultural history. The river and surrounding lands are the traditional territory of many First Nations peoples, who have been using this waterway and the surrounding land for 12,000 years to fish, hunt, travel and establish settlements. The Mississaugas called the river Kabechenong, meaning “gathering place to tie up.” When Europeans first colonized the area, it was known as the Toronto River or St. John’s River. In 1793, Upper Canada’s first Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe named it “Humber,” after the mouth of a large river near his family estate in England. In the following centuries, European colonists established roads and bridges, milling industries, dams and retaining walls. Many of these developments and their impacts on the natural river can be seen today. The Humber River originates on the Niagara Escarpment and the Oak Ridges Moraine and flows south into Lake Ontario. The main body of water runs 126 kilometres and connects to approximately 750 creeks and tributaries north of the city. Its banks are rich with wildlife and plant life. To date, 918 plant species, 143 birds, 30 mammals and 61 species of fish have been identified.

By controlling this area, the Seneca were able to organize trade with the English, Dutch and French traders. Although there are many accounts of the village's decline, it was most likely destroyed in 1687 by an attack led by the Marquis de Denonville, Governor of New France, which pushed the Seneca out of the area.

The farmlands on Eglinton Avenue from Victoria Park Avenue eastwards were soon transformed into the Golden Mile industrial complex. To attract businesses during Canada’s post-war economic boom, the land was offered at inexpensive prices and low property taxes. Since then, the Golden Mile attracted a range of major companies, including Delco, Thermos, Frigidaire, and car manufacturers like General Motors and Volkswagen. In 1954, the Golden Mile Plaza opened at Victoria Park Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East, becoming the largest shopping centre in Canada at the time. In 1959, the Golden Mile Plaza was even visited by Queen Elizabeth II. While the area was booming for a number of decades, many of these industries have moved out since the 1980s. Today, there are plans to redevelop the area into a residential and commercial centre.

McCarthy’s mother called the property a “fool’s paradise” because she thought the purchase was an excessive spend for the then young art teacher. But after Doris McCarthy designed and built the home, completed in 1946, it became a symbol of her creativity. Fool’s Paradise nurtured McCarthy’s artistic process and she wanted to give other artists an opportunity to live and work at the site that fostered so much of her own artistic expression. To that end, she bequeathed Fool’s Paradise to the Ontario Heritage Trust, which established the Doris McCarthy Artist-in-Residence Centre. This unique, living and working incubator for visual artists of all disciplines offers privacy and an opportunity for creative concentration. Fool’s Paradise is occasionally open to the public for events such as Doors Open Toronto. McCarthy graduated from the University of Toronto Scarborough in 1989.

The river and surrounding lands are the traditional territory of many First Nations peoples, who have been using this waterway and the surrounding land for 12,000 years to fish, hunt, travel and establish settlements. The Mississaugas called the river Kabechenong, meaning 'gathering place to tie up.' When Europeans first colonized the area, it was known as the Toronto River or St. John's River. In 1793, Upper Canada's first Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe named it Humber, after the mouth of a large river near his family estate in England. In the following centuries, European colonists established roads and bridges, milling industries, dams and retaining walls. Many of these developments and their impacts on the natural river can be seen today. The Humber River originates on the Niagara Escarpment and the Oak Ridges Moraine and flows south into Lake Ontario. The main body of water runs 126 kilometres, where it then branches in two directions. The eastern branch flows 63 kilometres and the west branch flows   45 kilometres. However, the Humber River connects to approximately 750 creeks and tributaries north of the city. The Humber River and its banks are rich with wildlife and plant life. To date, 918 plant species have been identified, along with 143 birds, 30 mammals and 61 species of fish. Along the river, there are currently more than 1,200 potential in-stream barriers, including elevated culverts, dams, weirs and watercourse crossings. This is a concern because a key factor in healthy, self-sustaining populations of fish is their ability to migrate freely within the river system.

In 1959, the Toronto Port Authority began construction of the peninsula, filling in the lake with dredged sand and construction waste and extending the spit 5 kilometres into Lake Ontario. In the 1970s, it became apparent that the land would no longer be needed for port facilities and by this time plant and wildlife had begun to take over the peninsula. The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority was granted care of the land from the Toronto Port Authority and developed the land into a public park, though sections continue to be used for landfill. Tommy Thompson Park is an important stopover for migrating birds and insects, particularly the Monarch Butterfly. The park is on the Monarchs' migratory route from Mexico to Canada. The species, which numbered in the billions a couple of decades ago, had declined by 95 percent by 2012. The City of Toronto has planted milkweed and other pollinator-friendly vegetation in Tommy Thompson Park and around the city in an effort to recover the Monarch Butterfly populations.

In 1912, public health concerns about this pollution led the Toronto Harbour Commission to drain the marsh and fill the bay in one of the largest engineering projects at the time in North America. In the coming decades, the former marsh would become 1,000 acres of useable land. This land was transformed into a new industrial district and remained a hub for industry until the 1970s. In 1977, the City of Toronto developed the land at Ashbridges Bay into the current waterfront park for recreational uses, such as walking, birdwatching, picnicking, fishing and sailing.
